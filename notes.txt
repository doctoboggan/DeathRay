General Questions:
-Is it possible to get the FPGA to output only one file instead of several? This would make a few things easier
-How will the files be updated in a real time situation?
-What is decoder address and Target Name? (XLS Sheet 1)?
-What info from the XLS should be included in the app?
-Is it better to pass arguments through functions or to simply save the argument as an instance variable and then have the called function read the instance variable?





ToDo:
-talk to the guy who wrote the perl script
----what do the differnt names mean?
-Make updateRunDisplay simply display everything in a given dictionary. Build this dictionary in FileProcessor so as to keep the experiment specific code in 1 file. --DONE--
-ultimately:
--Implement FileProcessor for a few different experiments, and then with this knowledge make an 'AbstractFileProcessor' that can be inherited by each of these implementations and future implementations
--Figure out how to save a plot to an image file
------ QPixmap.grabWidget(p).save('cli-plot-1.png', 'PNG')





Possible division of labor:
-someone get other sample data and start reimplementing FileProcessor to interpret it
-someone work on the interface, fleshing it out and making it look nicer.
-someone control hardware (GPIB)
-someone work on documentation
-someone becomea qwt expert and them implement a simpler/friendlier interface for future plugin authors
