General Questions:
-Is it possible to get the FPGA to output only one file instead of several? This would make a few things easier
-How will the files be updated in a real time situation?
-What is decoder address and Target Name? (XLS Sheet 1)?
-What info from the XLS should be included in the app?
-Is it better to pass arguments through functions or to simply save the argument as an instance variable and then have the called function read the instance variable?
-Why use getter methods instead of directly reading instance variables?





ToDo:
-talk to the guy who wrote the perl script DONE
----what do the differnt names mean? - Nothing, ignore them
-Make updateRunDisplay simply display everything in a given dictionary. Build this dictionary in FileProcessor so as to keep the experiment specific code in 1 file. --DONE--
-ultimately:
--Implement FileProcessor for a few different experiments, and then with this knowledge make an 'AbstractFileProcessor' that can be inherited by each of these implementations and future implementations
--Figure out how to save a plot to an image file
------ QPixmap.grabWidget(p).save('cli-plot-1.png', 'PNG')






Possible division of labor:
-someone get other sample data and start reimplementing FileProcessor to interpret it (Everyone)
-someone work on the interface, fleshing it out and making it look nicer. (jack)
-someone control hardware (GPIB) (Anas)
-someone work on documentation (Nadiah)
-someone becomea qwt expert and them implement a simpler/friendlier interface for future plugin authors (jack)








plot types:
histogram
line graph
  spline interpolation
  linear interpolation
  steps
scatter plot
heat map
These plot types should be sufficent according to daniel.











1/17 meeting
-be able to sort by decoder type or automeasure value
-if decoder is not specified, it is the same as the previous experiment --DONE-- (Same for automeasure??)
-no pulse listed is the smallest pulse detected. --DONE-- (set as 15)
-maybe include error bars (based on standard (counting) error)
-use flux as an input parameter and then plot count vs fluence 
    -(flux is the rate, fluence is the total number)
    -divide the estimated value by the square root of the counts (number of errors)
-include a table as a plot --DONE--
    -some basic statics (avg, max, min, etc) and parameters of the experiment
IP of gateway: 129.59.93.150

we need to implement "measure" for the devices that dont have it.

put together a state diagram of how the program operates --IN PROGRESS (Nadiah)--







1/18 class
Design day is Thursday, April 19th 2 to 4
Go to presentation next wednesday 3-4 in the jacobs auditorium instead of class
Talk to loveless about a special git account at ISDE









1/23 class
Weekly project reports due each friday.
Midterm design review (completed by March 16 - week after spring break)
  demonstrate real work
  say what needs to be done
  make fancy slides
  do this with loveless
For next week:
  list a design problem we are stuck on and bring it to class. Email it to holman






1/30 class
Talk about our UI next monday (2/6)
  be prepared to present the software so far.




1/7 meeting
plot error count vs time
  be able to key in flux rate
  first 2 bits are timestamp
  every 30 bits is one IC
  every two bits is a unique flip flop
release device at the bottom of class

supply:
  set current limit on the supply  
  set voltage   (it is not hard. However, we have to know how to specified a certain port to be modified)
  be able to specify port (for reading, It is DONE. For writing, It is going to be asked)
  read current coming out of power supply   (if you mean via multimeter, It is DONE. If you mean via the power supply, it is DONE too)
multimeter:
  current, voltage (AC/DC)    [DONE] (not yet fully tested)
oscope:
  change the trigger event (common: edge, or width)
    mode: normal vs auto
      auto: forces a trigger even if one doesnt exist
      norm: only triggers when it exists (generally used)
  download each channel (1,2)
  set timescale and voltage




Sunday 2/12 meeting:
what is level
how to set voltage of channel that is not on display
time out issues
ask nick about power supply coupling. 
which command is better apply or inst coup


20/2/2012 class
documentation:
user manual (will work on when modules are completed)
schematics (none)
code with comments (check)
Test procedure:
- bad user configuration
- breaking the software/crash
