Is it possible to get the FPGA to output only oen file instead of several? This would make a few things easier

What is decoder address and Target Name? (XLS Sheet 1):
Decoder Address (DEC)  Decoder Address ‘abcd’ (BIN)  Target Name
0 0000 DIRECT_INPUT
1 0001 inv_1x_avt_fb
2 0010 inv_1x_rvt
3 0011 24576_inv_1x_rvt
4 0100 OR_Tree_rvt
5 0101 inv_1x_rvt_bt
6 0110 OR_Tree_bt
7 0111 nhit_rvt
8 1000 phit_bt
9 1001 nhit_bt
10 1010 inv_1x_to_bt
11 1011 inv_5x_s_rvt
12 1100 inv_1x_to
13 1101 OR_Tree_to
14 1110 phit_rvt
15 1111 inv_5x_f_rvt

Valid AUTOMEAS codes range from 0 to 7 and represent the percentage of the on-chip measurement circuit utilized for "digitizing" the transient widths.  Each file should be set for a given setting (1 decoder mode and 1 autopw mode).

AUTOMEAS Percentage of Measurement Circuit Utilized
0 30%
1 49%
2 56%
3 70%
4 80%
5 OVERFLOW
6 NOT VALID
7 NOT VALID

Is it better to pass arguments through functions or to simply save the argument as an instance variable and then have the called function read the instance variable?

ToDo:
-talk to the guy who wrote the perl script
----what do the differnt names mean?
-Make updateRunDisplay simply display everything in a given dictionary. Build this dictionary in FileProcessor so as to keep the experiment specific code in 1 file.
-ultimately:
--Implement FileProcessor for a few different experiments, and then with this knowledge make an 'AbstractFileProcessor' that can be inherited by each of these implementations and future implementations
--Figure out how to save a plot to an image file

Possible division of labor:
-someone get other sample data and start reimplementing FileProcessor to interpret it
-someone work on the interface, fleshing it out and making it look nicer.
