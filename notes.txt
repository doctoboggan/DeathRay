General Questions:
-Is it possible to get the FPGA to output only one file instead of several? This would make a few things easier
-How will the files be updated in a real time situation?
-What is decoder address and Target Name? (XLS Sheet 1)?
-What info from the XLS should be included in the app?
-Is it better to pass arguments through functions or to simply save the argument as an instance variable and then have the called function read the instance variable?
-Why use getter methods instead of directly reading instance variables?





ToDo:
-talk to the guy who wrote the perl script DONE
----what do the differnt names mean? - Nothing, ignore them
-Make updateRunDisplay simply display everything in a given dictionary. Build this dictionary in FileProcessor so as to keep the experiment specific code in 1 file. --DONE--
-ultimately:
--Implement FileProcessor for a few different experiments, and then with this knowledge make an 'AbstractFileProcessor' that can be inherited by each of these implementations and future implementations
--Figure out how to save a plot to an image file
------ QPixmap.grabWidget(p).save('cli-plot-1.png', 'PNG')






Possible division of labor:
-someone get other sample data and start reimplementing FileProcessor to interpret it (Everyone)
-someone work on the interface, fleshing it out and making it look nicer. (jack)
-someone control hardware (GPIB) (Anas)
-someone work on documentation (Nadiah)
-someone becomea qwt expert and them implement a simpler/friendlier interface for future plugin authors (jack)








plot types:
histogram
line graph
  spline interpolation
  linear interpolation
  steps
scatter plot
heat map
These plot types should be sufficent according to daniel.











1/17 meeting
-be able to sort by decoder type or automeasure value
-if decoder is not specified, it is the same as the previous experiment --DONE-- (Same for automeasure??)
-no pulse listed is the smallest pulse detected. --DONE-- (set as 15)
-maybe include error bars (based on standard (counting) error)
-use flux as an input parameter and then plot count vs fluence 
    -(flux is the rate, fluence is the total number)
    -divide the estimated value by the square root of the counts (number of errors)
-include a table as a plot --DONE--
    -some basic statics (avg, max, min, etc) and parameters of the experiment
IP of gateway: 129.59.93.150

we need to implement "measure" for the devices that dont have it.

put together a state diagram of how the program operates --IN PROGRESS (Nadiah)--







1/18 class
Design day is Thursday, April 19th 2 to 4
Go to presentation next wednesday 3-4 in the jacobs auditorium instead of class
Talk to loveless about a special git account at ISDE









1/23 class
Weekly project reports due each friday.
Midterm design review (completed by March 16 - week after spring break)
  demonstrate real work
  say what needs to be done
  make fancy slides
  do this with loveless
For next week:
  list a design problem we are stuck on and bring it to class. Email it to holman
