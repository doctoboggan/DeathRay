This file contains useful information about the gbip port. 

Note: Some commands may notwork in some devices (depend on how smart are these devices). Any way, I will see if they work or not.
NOTE: Maybe there are some grammer mistakes :)  .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&&Note: (10) means a device on the network, which the address of the GBIP equal to 10 (for now)  //I have to find the name of the device and replace the number by the name
&&Note: (22) means a device on the network, which the address of the GBIP equal to 22 (for now)  //I have to find the name of the device and replace the number by the name


&&START:

1----> to get the value of dc voltage : 
==  meas:volt:dc?
*works on all (10,22)
2----> to get the value of ac voltage : 
==  meas:volt:ac?
*works on (22)
3----> to get the value of dc voltage : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:VOLTage:DC?
*works on all (10,22)
4----> to get the value of ac voltage : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:VOLTage:AC?
*works on (22)
5----> To get the value of dc current : 
== meas:curr:dc?
*works on all (10,22)
6----> To get the value of dc current : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:CURRent:DC?
*works on all (10,22)
7---> To get the value of ac current : 
== meas:curr:ac?
*works on (22)
8---> To get the value of ac current : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEANsure:CURRent:AC?
*works on (22)
9---> I am not sure what does this value mean?? ( :\ )  :  //I have to find the meaning?
== meas:volt:dc:rat?
*works on (22)
