This file contains useful information about the gpib port. 

NOTE: Some commands may notwork in some devices (depend on how smart are these devices). Any way, I will see if they work or not.
NOTE: Maybe there are some grammer mistakes :)  .


**** FOR POWER SUPPLY:***

--Example:
#---> the defination of the commands :
== The command

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&&Note: (10) means E3631A DMM 
&&Note: (22) means 34401A DMM


&&START:

1----> to get the value of dc voltage : 
==  meas:volt:dc?
*works on all (10,22)
2----> to get the value of ac voltage : 
==  meas:volt:ac?
*works on (22)
3----> to get the value of dc voltage : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:VOLTage:DC?
*works on all (10,22)
4----> to get the value of ac voltage : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:VOLTage:AC?
*works on (22)
5----> To get the value of dc current : 
== meas:curr:dc?
*works on all (10,22)
6----> To get the value of dc current : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEASure:CURRent:DC?
*works on all (10,22)
7---> To get the value of ac current : 
== meas:curr:ac?
*works on (22)
8---> To get the value of ac current : (the result is different (I have not find why yet))  //I have to find the different
== MEANsure:CURRent:AC?
*works on (22)
9---> I am not sure what does this value mean?? ( :\ )  :  //I have to find the meaning?
== meas:volt:dc:rat?
*works on (22)

$$Note: it is going to be continued 


***Connection via TCP in python***

$$Note: The ip address is 129.59.73.80 ---- The port is 80 (it is http. I found that from my firewill mintoring screen)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~the code~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1 #!/usr/bin/env python
   2 
   3 import socket    //to call the TCP library. For that, this library has to be installed in user's computer. So, we have to add this informaion to requirment page (readme)  [NOT DONE]
   4 
   5 
   6 TCP_IP = '129.59.73.80'     //This is the ip for now
   7 TCP_PORT = 80		// The port number
   8 BUFFER_SIZE = 16384	//just a dafult 
   9 MESSAGE="meas:volt:dc?"	//here is going to be the command (this command as an example)			**
  10 
  11 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  12 s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))
  13 s.send(MESSAGE)
  14 data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)
  15 s.close()
  16 
  17 print "the voltage is: ", data	//here to print the result of the comand				**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&&Note: This code require testing  [NOT DONE]
&&Note: There are some ideas, which may be useful to the code: 
	1) This code should be in separate class. So that, it will be called each time (assume each 0.5 second). Moreover, when it is called, the call will specific the coommand*.  
	2) We may not need to print the result. We only need to return the result to the caller. 
	3) We may need to check the result. In other words, some commands may not work with some devices. So, we have to make sure if the command will work or not.
