ACQuire:MODE <mode>
<mode> ::= {RTIMe | ETIMe | SEGMented}
RTime is real time mode
ETime is equivalent time mode

:ACQuire:TYPE <type>
<type> ::= {NORMal | AVERage | HRESolution | PEAK}

• The :ACQuire:TYPE NORMal command sets the oscilloscope in the
normal mode.
• The :ACQuire:TYPE AVERage command sets the oscilloscope in the
averaging mode. You can set the count by sending the :ACQuire:COUNt
command followed by the number of averages. In this mode, the value
for averages is an integer from 1 to 65536. The COUNt value determines
the number of averages that must be acquired.
Setting the :ACQuire:TYPE to AVERage automatically sets
:ACQuire:MODE to ETIMe (equivalent time sampling).
The AVERage type is not available when in segmented memory mode
(:ACQuire:MODE SEGMented).
• The :ACQuire:TYPE HRESolution command sets the oscilloscope in the
high- resolution mode (also known as smoothing). This mode is used to
reduce noise at slower sweep speeds where the digitizer samples faster
than needed to fill memory for the displayed time range.

:SAVE:WAVeform[:STARt] [<file_name>]
<file_name> ::= quoted ASCII string
The :SAVE:WAVeform[:STARt] command saves oscilloscope waveform data
to a file.

:TRIGger:MODE
(see page 798)
Command Syntax :TRIGger:MODE <mode>
<mode> ::= {EDGE | GLITch | PATTern | CAN | DURation | I2S |IIC
| EBURst | LIN | M1553| SEQuence | SPI | TV | UART
| USB | FLEXray}
The :TRIGger:MODE command selects the trigger mode (trigger type).
Query Syntax :TRIGger:MODE?
The :TRIGger:MODE? query returns the current trigger mode. If the
:TIMebase:MODE is ROLL or XY, the query returns "NONE".
